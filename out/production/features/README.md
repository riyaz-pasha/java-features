# Java New Features

## Java 8

* Functional interfaces
* Lambda Expression
* Method references
* Interface changes: Default and static methods
* Streams
* Optional class with example

#### Functional Interface

- An interface with only single abstract method is called functional interface.
- Also known as Single Abstract Method interfaces (SAM Interfaces)

Example of Predefined Functional interfaces

* **Consumer** - has only abstract method **_accept_**
* **Predicate** - has only abstract method **_test_**
* **Supplier** - has only abstract method **_get_**
* **Function** - has only abstract method **_apply_**
* **BiFunction** - has only abstract method **_apply_**


## Java 11

* New String Methods

* Not Predicate Method
    * _Predicate.not(String::isBlank)_
